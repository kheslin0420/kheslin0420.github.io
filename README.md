# Welcome!

This is a place where I will post python code used to do various tasks associated with archival work. While I recognize that there are many others out there
contributing similar content, I think its helpful to have a multitude of scripts to work with. Additionally, I will try to explain each bit of code
within the script itself, but with an additional blog post as well. I feel that I can provide more extensive instruction in a blog post than in the script 
itself.
