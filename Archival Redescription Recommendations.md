# Background

This document was created as source for **suggestions** and **recommendations** of how to approach/think about archival redescription in archival finding aids and item level metadata. As such, the information provided here does not seek to be the definitive guide to the ongoing work of reparative redescritpion and should be seen as an ever evolving, iterative set of guidelines that archivists and the like can take inspiration from. I do not believe in dogmatic principles, and feel the archival profession rests too frequently on such. In light of this, I hope these recommendations will help archivists to think critically, ethically, and empathetically about the records we care for. 

Many of these recommendation have been expressed by others committed to reparative redescrition in Archives, but exist as dispersed articles, reports, and guidelines. I do not claim these recommedations as products of my own conceptualization, and recognize the work of many archivists/librians/information specialists to formulate them:

## Immediate Action 

Reparative redescription takes time and a great deal of care. It requires the archivist to think critically and to consider layers of historical narrative not immediately apparent. One must go beyond the superficial layer of record description, to consider how archival collections contribute to, reinforce, or deconstruct notions of personhood, identity, social wealth, and community. And, for redescription to be truly reparative, it must be social justice oriented. It should seek to work for communities, to empower their narratives and uplift their voices. This is only possible through community collaboration and consultation, which is a result of **meaningful**, **equitable**, and **sustained relationships**. For this reason, redescription cannot, and should not, be undertaken as a quick solution to the racist, harmful and oppressive language that can be found in the archive, as a result of past descriptive practices. 

However, this doesn’t mean that immediate action cannot be taken to reduce the emotional and psychological harm that can result from such language and description. To provide some sort of immediate action, the following is suggested:

- Develop an easily accessbile document (ideally a webpage living in the same platform where finding aids are served to the public) where patrons can be educated on the differences between creator supplied metadata and archivist supplied description and efforts to address the later. 

- Implement a new, standardized note at the top most level of finding aids identified as containing problematic langauge with the label (or type) of “Content Advisory” that states the following: 
  - “This finding aid contains records that have been flagged as including Creator supplied language that is potentially offensive or harmful. Researchers should bear this in mind when accessing. For more information on language in Archival Description, please visit our “A Notice on Harmful, Offensive, or Misrepresentative Archival Description and Language” page.

- Ensure communication is open and accessible so that, when outdated, racists, or harmful langauge is found by patrons, they have the means to communicate to archivists. This has been implemented by several institutions, however [Princeton Univeristy Library](https://findingaids.princeton.edu/) seems to have led this initiative with their "Suggest a Correction" link that can be found on all finding aids. [example](https://findingaids.princeton.edu/catalog/C1052_c01). For a finding aid, it is ideal to have this appear on each series level. 

## Analysis 

A thorough review of **all** descriptions is necessary in order to create an archival environment where all communities and identities are welcomed, adequately represented, and appropriately described. We may begin with the collections idenitfied using scripts and automation, but ultimately, all the memories we steward deserve the same level of review. This type of review requires careful consideration and thoughtful analysis. The following questions may help to inform broader representation in archival description: 

- For what purpose were these records created?
   - Whose perspective are they meant to convey?
   - Whose perspective is absent?
   - What power structures are the records meant to reinforce? What discourse are they trying to dominate?

- What are the conditions (or context) of their existence?

- How is it that this particular record (on a collection or item level) came to be, rather than another? What instance, or person(s), made this record possible?

- Are we restricting the “creator” to the corporate body, person, or family responsible for an entire body of materials? In doing so, **whose voices have we suppressed?** What other communities or individuals can be identified as creators of these records under the following definition: *In addition to the corporate body, person, or family responsible for an entire body of materials, the individuals and communities that interacted, intersected, influenced, or allowed the creation of the records should also be identified as records creators. Otherwise, we prioritize one voice over another.*

- How does the existence of the record, in its current state of description dehumanize, objectify, subvert or degrade cultures and individuals described?

- Who are the records currently most accessible to?
  - Think of the language currently used to describe the records. Are they in the language of the community from which they originate?
  - Are the terms used to describe the records those currently used by communities and individuals to define themselves? 
  - Have we highlighted collections and objects not immediately identifiable as related to specific communities, so that they can be researched and referenced as part of their history?
