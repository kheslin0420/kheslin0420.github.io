# Background

This document was created as source for **suggestions** and **recommendations** of how to approach/think about archival redescription in Archives & Special collections. As such, the information provided here does not seek to be the definitive guide to the ongoing work of reparative redescritpion and should be seen as an ever evolving, iterative set of guidelines that archivists and the like can take inspiration from. I do not believe in dogmatic principles, and feel the archival profession rests too frequently on such. In light of this, I hope these recommendations will help archivists to think critically, ethically, and empathetically about the records we care for. 

Many of these recommendation have been expressed by others committed to reparative redescrition in Archives, but exist as dispersed articles, reports, and guidelines. I do not claim these recommedations as products of my own conceptualization, and recognize the work of many archivists/librians/information specialists to formulate them:

## Immediate Action 

Reparative redescription takes time and a great deal of care. It requires the archivist to think critically and to consider layers of historical narrative not immediately apparent. One must go beyond the superficial layer of record description, to consider how archival collections contribute to, reinforce, or deconstruct notions of personhood, identity, social wealth, and community. And, for redescription to be truly reparative, it must be social justice oriented. It should seek to work for communities, to empower their narratives and uplift their voices. This is only possible through community collaboration and consultation, which is a result of **meaningful**, **equitable**, and **sustained relationships**. For this reason, redescription cannot, and should not, be undertaken as a quick solution to the racist, harmful and oppressive language that can be found in the archive, as a result of past descriptive practices. 

However, this doesn’t mean that immediate action cannot be taken to reduce the emotional and psychological harm that can result from such language and description. To provide some sort of immediate action, the following is suggested:

- 
- Implement a new, standardized note at the top most level of finding aids identified as containing problematic langauge with the label of “Content Advisory” that states the following: 
  -“This finding aid contains records that have been flagged as including Creator supplied language that is potentially offensive or harmful. Researchers should bear this in mind when accessing.
